2,,I think this year's format does not work well since the client's requirements are vague.,Requirements
2,,"And since we only get to update to the client and get the feedback at the end of the term, a lot of our work and efforts went wasted (i.e. tear down the OpenShift service, have to shift some of our tech stacks to AWS because the client wants to utilize it but only said at the end of the term...).

2,,"If we can update the client every week, this problem can be pretty much avoided.",Requirements
2,,I would have preferred more direct contact with the clients as to get a more direct experience in working for an actual client.,Communication
2,,Also heard a lot of negative experiences in the past years where students felt like they had to scrap features they had implemented as the client didn't like it.,"Process, Requirements"

2,,I think communicating with your supervisors and having meeting with them is a good knowledge and skillset to have. ,Generic
2,,When I was working in a co-op setting that was the format when I was producing code for the project and it helped me a lot where I would learn to communicate properly and clearly. ,Requirements

2,,I always looked forward to capstone as a project where we would be dealing with client 1-on-1 as a team and work with them.,Generic
2,,It was interesting to work in a team and create a project and then the clients would rate us based on that project.,Generic

2,,It was also nice to have all our projects graded by the client.,Panel
2,,I got a chance to see other peoples perspective on the same project.,Benefit
2,,This allowed me to learn one or two things if i were to do it again.,Benefit
2,,It was more beneficial and got to learn a lot from the process as well eventually with team and did not feel like a hassle.,Stress
2,,"I found the ""hackathon format"" less effective because we have no clue how to approach the project. ",Requirements
2,,The evaluation of the project at each step of the course was changing all the time and we could not have a set focus of the things that we should be aiming for. ,Requirements
2,,"The core of the hackathon is that the team can choose their own topic and set up it's own criteria of the goal that they should be targeted, but capstone is nowhere near this approach.",Freedom
2,,I think allowing us to decide our project scope and personal deadlines helped us to work around bugs or errors found. ,Freedom
2,,"If a client would have set definite requirements, that may have hindered our ability to learn, while also creating a more stressful environment than it already was.","Requirements, Stress"

2,,The little competition at the end helps boost the team's energy to push the project to the final.,Motivation
2,,"although the traditional way is closer to how it would be in industry and would prepare us more, i think this hackathon format somewhat made people in the same option in a common struggle so we could always ask each other for help as we all had similar issues.",Process

2,,The hackathon format let us be more creativity and does not have as strict requirements which allows us to make the project the way we want it.,Freedom
2,,Had a lack of direction sometimes due to not meeting a client while still being judged by them at the end. Seems counter intuitive,"Requirements, Panel"
2,,I think it was less stressful than meeting with a client would have been.,"Stress, Communication"

2,,"I think for our project specifically, it was kind of 50/50 but ultimately proved to be more of a challenge. ",Process

2,,I think that not having as much interaction allowed us to naturally adjust what we needed to work on and not be forced to every week to adjust our priorities. ,Requirements

2,,Maybe a little bit more interaction but not every week would be best.,Requirements
2,,I think this is a good format to allow more flexibility on our side and let some of us practice managing a project in terms of work done and time commitment. ,"Freedom, Process"
2,,"I think it would also be a lot more stressful, and maybe more unrealistic in terms of deadlines, if we are working with a client and they expect a bit more from us than what we actually have time for (considering it's not a full time job and there's also other courses with their own assignment and projects to be done.)","Stress, Requirements, Process"

2,, I also like the idea that we had unified sense of what the other teams were supposed to do (mostly),Motivation
2,,I feel like it left significantly more time to work on the project and plan what was needed. ,Process
2,,"We were able to make an initial plan based on the ""theme"", and then modify it to be within the scope and the feedback the client gave in December.",Requirements
2,,It gives you more freedom regarding what you can add to your project rather than just using the client requirements every week.,Freedom
2,,I would prefer to have directed feedback rather than the periodic general feedback. ,Communication
2,,Having a more involved client would give the project more of an 'in the field' feel.,Process
2,,"Yes, I liked this as I had friends who took this course before this year and had difficulty completing the project while having to manage the expectations of the client.","Requirements, Freedom"
2,,"Although it did have significant merits and has a lot of potential, the hackathon format made the experience of Capstone feel like another standard (but long term) University project. ",Process
2,,"We essentially were entirely disconnected from the people who would judge the project at the end, and it often felt like the vision and requirements of the professor and TA's were misaligned with what the client was asking for and would judge us on. ","Panel, Requirements"
2,,"I felt further distanced by the fact that the lion's share of my work and grade was determined by TA's by way of the weekly logs, which were often redundant and tedious to write.",Grading
2,, I felt like that time spent working on the logs would have been better spent on properly maintaining the Github Project board and having the TA evaluate our work through those specially made project management tools instead of logs which mostly pointed to information already available there and in the repo. ,Grading
2,,"Additionally, I felt like the ""feature every 2 weeks"" model was often more ambiguous and restrictive than not. ","Requirements, Freedom"
2,,"Some work was counted as a feature, some wasn't, and I didn't feel like whether it counted or not was related to the actualy need for that work in the project. ",Requirements
2,,"I would have rather spent more properly testing and polishing a smaller number of core features and dealing with issues as they came rather than having to do all of that and also find something new to make that counted as a ""feature"" but did not add to the project's core goals. ",Requirements
2,,"I do not feel like this was a representative experience of what working in the industry will be like and what I might want to do in it, which I originally felt was the objective of Capstone. ",Process
2,,"However, something that was quite positive about this format was the ability to chose what project we wanted to work on, and I would have loved if the project prompts were even more open ended and allowed for more creative ideas.",Freedom
2,,"This format does have potential and merit over the old system, and I would like to see it grow in a direction which prioritized a genuine creative engineering experience for students. ",Process
2,,"I commend the university for trying something new with Capstone and listening to students about what didn't work before, it is felt and appreciated.",Process
2,,My opinion is yes to no preference.,Generic
2,, It is hard to say that it is better than previous capstone classes as I don't have much knowledge about them but this year's capstone did feel pretty good with the amount of client interaction. ,Communication
2,,I think it was good to separate the client from the students as many students are still at a university level of understanding of software development and Professors and TAs have a better understanding of student abilities than clients in industry do.,Communication
2,,It made the capstone project feel more competitive and industry standard work was produced over all teams.,"Process, Motivation"
2,,"i feel this method allows students more creative control, rather than a client telling them what to do. ","Freedom, Benefit"
2,,"plus, it may be hard dealing with clients (even though we are probably going to face situations like that in the future).",Communication
2,,"It is hard to give an honest answer considering I only experienced the course one of the two ways, but from what I heard the pressure the clients put on students when they were more involved wasn't fair and I didn't have that experience with the hackathon style.",Stress
2,,I liked the format because it allowed me to build a project which I wanted to work on. ,Freedom
2,,"Working on a project I wanted to work on meant that I cared about the project far more, which caused me to take the course more seriously.","Freedom, Benefit"
2,,While I did really enjoy the format that the capstone was in this semester I still believe it could be extremely useful for my peers and I to get the full client experience so we have a better understanding of what the work force will actually be like.,Process
2,,However this is not a criticism of the style it was in this year as I have not experienced the client focused format and truly don't know which one I would prefer.,Process
2,Positive response,Working within a theme rage may give us a more clear instruction to do,"Requirements, Freedom"
2,,I feel like the hackathon format provided a little more flexibility for students when working on the capstone projects whereas having a set of client requirements every week especially for any student who has a full time course load probably would have been a lot more stressful.,"Stress, Freedom"
2,,I think that system is better. ,Generic
2,,"I think working with client requirements every week would make everything more complicated, changing and unclear requirements would make project planning more difficult. ",Requirements
2,,This way I think students can focus more on building their system than on meeting client requirements.,Requirements
2,,Its a better choice since  the client has already outlined their expectations and provided necessary resources upfront. ,"Process, Requirements"
2,,This can streamline the process and potentially reduce the need for frequent changes. ,Requirements
2,,The requirement can varies if we meet client and working with them every week based on what we bring up every week.,Requirements
2,," Depending on what is discussed each week, the project requirements may fluctuate, potentially leading to more frequent changes and iterations throughout the project timeline.",Requirements
2,,It's because we as students can express our creativity and make something that we like thus making us put in more effort in research and coding our project theme.,"Freedom, Motivation"
2,,"Having done the video game option, I think it's less of a product that could be requested by a client, which is nice because it gave me the opportunity to to work on an area of the industry that I wouldn't have otherwise done during my degree. ","Freedom, Benefit"
2,,I also appreciated having a lot of creative freedom.,Freedom
2,,I liked the hackathon format more rather than sitting with a client and work on requirements on a weekly basis as it was upto us as a team to add features and decide how the project will be based on a theme. ,"Process, Requirements"
2,,This gave us a chance to know our own limitations and to see how much can we do as a team for our project. ,Generic
2,,"If we had a client and we got a task for each week which is not plausible with our team's skill level or any other reason it gets very hard to complete that requirement because the client just wants the work, they don't care much about how the team functions and everyone's skill level.","Process, Requirements"
2,, Plus all team members have other courses as well and we had to balance our own time and tasks accordingly.,Stress
2,,I believe that the industry connections made through working directly with a client would have been really valuable. ,Communication

2,,"While meeting with a client every week is a valuable experience, it can be frustrating and may limit the potential of the project due to client expectations, requirements, or knowledge. ",Requirements
2,,"The more open format allowed more space to lead the project in a direction that increased the learning potential of the project, especially since the web dev courses at the school are lacking.",Freedom
2,,It gave (the students) to harness our creative potential and build something that we wanted.,Freedom

2,," This may not play out in industry, but provides a great starting but to flesh out our skillset.",Process
2,,The reason I chose yes for liking this course format is because it gave us students more time to host a meeting within our project group members rather than meeting the client every week and going to meet at some places outside of school. ,Freedom
2,,Hosting more meetings within our group will enhance our communication and help each other in the project work process. ,Requirements
2,,This format can give us students a clear topic of our project rather than a blurry topic from the client which changes every week. ,Requirements
2,,I would recommend continuing to use this format next year.,Process
2,,The hackathon theme did sound fun but it turned out rather a bad idea:  ,Process
2,,Work wasted: The project description was rather vague and unfortunately didn't capture what the client really wanted.,Requirements
2,," I supposed there was miscommunication; however, it could have been solved by the client describing it to us. ",Requirements
2,,"Our initial project proposal was accepted but feedback from the client after seeing the prototype was mostly not favorable, causing us to do a major overhaul of the system architecture. ",Requirements

2,,I think a little more feedback/involvement would have been a good balance.,Communication
2,,I like competing with other teams and see their perspectives,Motivation
2,,i heard in previous years when working with client they expected too much from students as if it was their full time job even though we are students with other classes,Process
2,,Hard to say given I haven't experienced the latter method. ,Generic
2,,"I certainly would have preferred if we were told early on that our design choice for a video processing API server was 'incorrect', which may have happened if we had kept a closer contact with the clients. ",Requirements
2,,"As it stands, we spent a substantial amount of time building out the server, giving it many important features based on the fact that our project proposal was accepted (and, in fact, we received a 100% on it). ",Requirements
2,,"However, come end of term 1, we were told we had to completely redesign our video processing data flow to use AWS Lambdas, which we were not told initially was a design requirement nor were we penalized for in our project proposal for not including.",Requirements
